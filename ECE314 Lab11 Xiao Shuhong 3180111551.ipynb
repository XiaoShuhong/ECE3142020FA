    "In this lab we're to going analyze evolutionary games using drift analysis. In order to do this, we first need to determine how to integrate ordinary differential equations. So, we begin with a brief exposure of how to achieve this in Python. While we're at it, we'll do a short exercise about failure rate functions.  Then we examine some evolutionary games, using both a stochastic model and a deterministic model, which involves the differential equations."

    "This section gives an introdution to integrating ordinary differential equations (odes), with an application to the calculation of a CDF from a failure rate function.  If you recall from your math classes we can describe an ODE as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{y}=f(y),$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where both $y$ and the function $f$ are vector valued, and $\\dot{y}$ is shorthand for $\\frac{dy}{dt}.$   The variables being vector valued simply implies that we could have a system of dependent one dimensional (1D) ODEs as opposed to just a single one dimensional variable.  Let's look at the following system:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\\binom{\\dot{y_0}}{\\dot{y_1}} = \\binom{2y_1-0.1y_0}{-y_0}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "with the initial condition $y_{init}=\\binom{y_1(0)}{y_2(0)}=\\binom{1}{1}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in using Python is not to find a closed form solution to the ODE as you would have probably done in your math class, but to numerically integrate it and produce a graphical solution. In order to do this we use the odeint method from scipy.integrate. It takes a function with an initial value and specified times at which the solution is to be output. Internally, the numerical method will often use a much finer grid of time points to solve the ode -- but that is none of your concern.   The times you put in are the times at with the method needs to provide the values of the solution. Look how it is used below:"

    "Typically in a plot like this you would add an arrow to indicate the direction of time in the graph. However, we know the initial state is $y_{init}=\\binom{1}{1}.$ So as time increases, the trajectory moves concentrically inwards in a clockwise fashion. Depending on how much of differential equations you remember, this solution should make sense. The equation happens to have a linear form and can be written as $\\dot y = Ay$ where\n",

    "The eigenvalues of $A$ are complex with negative real parts, so we would expect a decaying oscillatory behavior. (If you didn't follow that, don't worry about it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simple application of integrating a 1D (one-dimensional) ode, the following code calculates a CDF $F$ from its failure rate function $h.$ But first, let's look at some theory to remember what a failure rate function is. If we let $T$ be a positive random variable with a pdf $f_T$ then\n",
    "the failure rate function is defined by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(t)=\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\frac{P(t<T \\leq t+\\epsilon | T>t)}{\\epsilon}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalently, an object having failure rate function $h$ means that for any $t > 0,$ given\n",
    "that the object is still working at time $t$, the probability it will fail in the next\n",
    "$\\epsilon$ time units is $h(t)\\epsilon + o(\\epsilon)$.  (As usual, $o(\\epsilon)$ represents an error term such that $o(\\epsilon)/\\epsilon \\to 0$ as $\\epsilon\\to 0.$)  With a little bit more derivation (shown in Section 3.9 of your ECE 313 text), we can see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(t) = \\frac{f_T(t)}{1-F_T(t)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the pdf $f_T$ is the derivative of the CDF $F_T$. Here's where your 1D ODE comes into play. Given a failure rate function, we want to be able to calculate the CDF. We can easily turn this into an ODE. \n",
    "\n",
    "$f_T(t) = (1-F_T(t))h(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $F_T(t) = y$ and  $f_T(t) = \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\dot{y}$, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{y} = (1-y)h(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have our differential equation set up and we can solve it by the same method used in the previous example. For the code below, we define a particular bathtub shaped failure rate function to model the lifetime of a component such as a hard disk drive. There is a high, but decreasing initial rate of failure, followed be a period with a very low rate failure, followed by an increasing rate of failure. You should be able to think of reasons why an object might exhibit this type of failure rate function. Notice that the CDF behaves as we would expect: always between 0 and 1, and reactive to $h(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you examine the ECE 313 notes you'll see another way to determine $F_T,$  namely, using\n",
    "$F_T(t) = 1- \\exp \\left( \\int_o^t -h(s) ds \\right)$.  The point here, though, is to get some practice using\n",
    "odeint, instead of using this formula."

    "Consider a population of individuals, where each individual is of some type.  Suppose individuals have occasional pairwise encounters.  During an encounter the two individuals involved play a two player symmetric game in which the strategies are the types of the individuals.   As a result of the encounter, each of the two individuals produces a number of offspring of its same type, with the number being determined by a fitess table or, equivalently, a fitness matrix.   For example, consider a population of crickets such that each cricket is either small or large.   If two small crickets meet each other then they each spawn five more small crickets.  If a small cricket encounters a large cricket then the small cricket spawns one more small cricket and the large cricket spawns eight new large crickets.   If two large crickets meet then each of them spawns three new large crickets.  We can summarize these outcomes using the following table:\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{c|cc}  & small & large  \\\\ \\hline\n",
    "    small & 5 & 1  \\\\\n",
    "    large & 8 & 3\n",
    "    \\end{array}$$\n",
    "or by a fitness matrix\n",
    "$$F=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc}  5 & 1 \\\\ 8 & 3  \\end{array}\\right).$$ \n",
    "Associating 0 with \"small\" and 1 with \"large,\"  we see that if a type i individual encounters a type j individual, then the type i individual spawns F[i,j] new individuals of type i, and the type j individual spawns F[j,i] new individuals of type j. Below is a stochastic simulation for this game where we start with a population of four small crickets and four large crickets. It may be a useful exercise for you to think of how the values for $a$ and $b$ were created.\n"

    "The following code computes the deterministic analog of the cricket evolution.  The basic idea is that if the current population is [n[0], n[1]] then the drift (i.e. the expected rate of increase) of n[0] is n[0]  multiplied by the expected number of small crickets generated by a small cricket if an encounter happens.  That is true because each of the existing small crikets is having encounters at expected rate one.   To calculate the mean number of new small crickets generated by the encounter of a small cricket with a randomly selected other cricket, we use the law of total probability.  The encountered cricket is type zero with probabiity n[0]/(n[0]+n[1]), which results in F[0,0] new crickets of type zero, and the encountered cricket is type one with probability n[1]/(n[0]+n[1]), which results in F[0,1] new crickets of type zero.   Combining we get\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot{n}[0] = n[0]*(F[0,0]*n[0]+F[0,1]*n[1])/(n[0]+n[1])\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The equation just derived is based on the law of large numbers (LLN).  If the population is fairly large then no one individual plays a major role in the evolution.  Over a small period of time the ratios of small and large crickets is nearly constant, so the number of new crickets of each type in each time slot are nearly independent and identically distributed.   The LLN suggests approximating the sum of number of individuals of each type by the expected numbers of individuals of each type.  That's how we arrive at a deterministic differential equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar expression holds for the derivative of n[1], and the two equations can be writen in matrix form as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot{n} = diag(n)*F*n/sum(n)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where diag(n) is the diagonal matrix with n[0] and n[1] on the diagonal, and \"$*$\" represents usual matrix multiplication.   (In the python code below, \"$*$\" denotes element by element multiplication, which is used instead of creating a diagonal matrix, and np.dot is used for ordinary matrix multiplication.)"

    "where $\\mathbf{1}$ is the column vector of ones (the derivation is a bit involved, try deriving it by yourself if interested, but it is not required). The two components of the vector $F \\theta$ give the average fitness level of small crickets and large crickets, respectively, in an encounter with a cricket selected randomly from the population.   And $\\theta^T F \\theta$ is the weighted average of that vector, giving the average fitness over all crickets in the population.   Thus, $\\theta[0]$ is increasing exactly when the fitness of small crickets is greater than the average fitness.\n",

    "1. Modify the above code to integrate the equation for the $\\theta$ vector to obtain $\\theta$ vs. time.\n",
    "To check your answer, compare it to what you get by first computing the trajectory of $n$ and then calculating $\\theta$ from $n.$  (The code given above for deterministic evolution of n works for any number of types, not just two types. A problem below involves three types of individuals, so it'd be nice if you could implement your code for computing $\\theta$ to work for any number of types.) __Be careful when you write your program, since matrix multiplication in Python can be tricky. Understand \"$*$\" multiplication and np.dot multiplication first. After each small step, debug, confirm, then proceed.__ \n",
    "2. Using the fact that $\\theta[1]=1-\\theta[0],$  a differential equation can be derived for the variable $\\theta[0]$ alone.\n",
    "Plot the function $h$ on the interval $[0,1]$ such that $\\dot{\\theta}[0]=h(\\theta[0]).$ Note that the horizontal axis of the graph is $\\theta$, the vertical axis is $\\dot{\\theta}$. (You can just do this\n",
    "numerically.  It can also be done algebrically; in fact $h$ is a cubic polynomial, but it is a bit complicated to find the polynomial.)\n",
    "3. What are the zeroes of $h$ (those are the equilibrium points of $\\theta[0]$)?  Which of those are stable (in the sense that if $\\theta[0]$ is slightly moved away from the equilibrium point, it returns to the equilibrium point)?"

(The hawks are so aggressive that they attack the doves).  A dove has higher fitness, 3, against another dove than against a hawk, 1.
